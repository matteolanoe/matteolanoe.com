## About Me

Hi! My name is Mattéo Lanoë and I am a first-year Sociology PhD Candidate between the [Center for Research on social InequalitieS (CRIS)](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/en/) at Sciences Po and the [Mortality, Health and Epidemiology](https://mse.site.ined.fr/en/) research unit at [Ined](https://www.ined.fr). My research is supervised by [Anne Revillard](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/fr/annuaire/revillard-anne/) at CRIS, and [Émilie Counil](https://www.ined.fr/fr/recherche/chercheurs/Counil+Emilie+) at Ined. I am funded by the Sciences Po School of Research Doctoral Scholarship, for the 2025-2028 period. 

I am a graduate of the School of Research ('25), where I obtained my Master's of Research (MRes) in Sociology—which had a strong focus on both theory and methods. My master's dissertation dove into a sociology of dispositions and socialization approach to Long Covid management, and was supervised by [Anne Revillard](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/fr/annuaire/revillard-anne/) at CRIS.
